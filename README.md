# image-classification-of-COVID19-CT-Scans

In this project we investigate the detecting of COVID-19 in CT scans (images) with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning. We make use of a simple Deep Convolution network to build a model with 2 alternate convolution and pooling layers followed by fully connected layer. To improve the performance, we make use of the He_normal initializer for weight initialization coupled with the ReLU Activation function. The model is built with various optimizers â€“ Adam, SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), RMSProp Root mean square ) and the performances are compared
